This is a file for us to utilize in creating our final documentation for the project! 


## Special Things for Us (Cut from final)

If you are looking for a good .md editor that's lightweight and simple, I am using [Typora](https://typora.io/), which is pretty simple. It has built in GitHub syntax, which shows exactly how it will show up in GitHub.

It would appear that neovim also has syntax support for markdown files too. Typora might be good to see how it will look in github though.
